The Bayesian variable order Markov model


= Efficient implementation =

== src/statististics/ ==
* ContextTree - The BVMM
* ContextTreeBMC - The Bayesian Markov chain
* ContextTreeCTW - A naive CTW implementation
* ContextTreePPM - The PPM-C.

== src/statistics/tests ==

context_tree_test.cc - test sequence prediction

= Old implementation (deprecated) = 

This one uses a stl/map for every depth (so D of trees of depth 1, ... , D) instead of an actual tree structure of depth D and so is very slow and memory hungry.
