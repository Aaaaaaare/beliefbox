#summary A (Bayesian) belief code base for sequential decision making

= Introduction =

This project implements a number of common algorithms for
problems in sequential inference and decision making.

It also includes some highly experimental code. The codebase
is extremely unstable and the API likely to change at any time.

This is a summary of the main features of the code-base:

= Algorithms == 

- Bayesian RL Search
- Expectation-Maximisation
- Policy Iteration
- Q-Learning
- Rollout Classification Policy Iteration
- Rollout Sampling Approximate Policy Iteration
- Sarsa
- MWAL
- Multi-MDP Value Iteration
- Thompson Sampling
- Value iteration (with action elimination)
- Variable order Markov reinforcement learning
- UCB, UCRL

= Models =

- Bayesian Non-Parametric Conditional Density Estimation
- Conjugate Priors (e.g. Normal/Wishart, Multinomial/Dirichlet)
- Context Trees and Bayesian Variable Order Markov Models
- Hidden Markov Models
- Inverse Reinforcement Learning Models
- KNN classifier
- Linear classifiers
- MDP Models
- Multitask Inverse Reinforcement Learning Models
